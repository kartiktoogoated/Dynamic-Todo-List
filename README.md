Dynamic Todo List Web Application
This repository contains a JavaScript code snippet for creating a dynamic todo list web application. The code manipulates the DOM (Document Object Model) to display and manage todo items based on data received. Additionally, it includes a function to delete todo items.

Features
Dynamically creates and updates todo items based on the provided data.
Allows users to delete todo items by clicking on a delete button associated with each todo item.
Supports periodic updating of todo items at regular intervals.

Understanding the Code:

The createDomElements function is responsible for creating and updating todo items based on the provided data.
The deleteTodo function is called when the delete button associated with a todo item is clicked, allowing users to delete that specific todo item.
The code uses a setInterval function to periodically update the todo list with new data at regular intervals.
Customization: You can customize the todo items' appearance and behavior by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code as needed.
